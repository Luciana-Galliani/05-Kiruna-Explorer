# Kiruna Explorer

Kiruna Explorer is an interactive platform that tells the story of Kiruna's relocationâ€”a monumental endeavor to preserve the city as it adapts to mining activities and evolving urban needs. The application features historical records, urban planning documents, and cultural highlights, offering an engaging way to explore Kiruna's past, present, and future.

Developed by Team 5 of the Software Engineering II course at Politecnico di Torino during the academic year 2024-2025.
